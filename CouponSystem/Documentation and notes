db_building package:
Contain 2 classes:
1. CreateDB - the Java code for derby DB creation with table creation
2. AlterTable - Class I used to change the JOIN tables from primary key on both columns
* I have moved all constraints from the JOIN tables as there is no point to have amount of coupons if they cannot be bought more them once
As well as there is no point to get all coupons. I did look on how to create a constrain to the whole entry so each customer can buy specific coupon
only once.

DBDAO classes - Notes
I have set the creation/update/delete methods in Customer and Company classes to return int so there is some answer to use when there is no success
In the Coupon Class I didn't do that as it is not a must and there I will need to use the exception in case of an error

Test classes:

1. ViewDB - shows the different tables and the content - print it to the console only
2. DAO tests:
    2.1 CustomerDAOTests - Test for CuatomerDBDAO methods
    2.2 CompanyDAOTests - Test for CompanyDBDAO methods
    2.3 CouponDAOTests - Test for CouponDBDAO methods
3. Facade tests:
    3.1 Admin Facade
    3.2 Company Facade
    3.3 Customer Facade

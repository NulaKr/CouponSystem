db_building package:
Contain 2 classes:
1. CreateDB - the Java code for derby DB creation with table creation
2. AlterTable - Class I used to change the JOIN tables from primary key on both columns
* I have moved all constraints from the JOIN tables as there is no point to have amount of coupons if they cannot be bought more them once
As well as there is no point to get all coupons. I did look on how to create a constrain to the whole entry so each customer can buy specific coupon
only once.
